# Turtle Crossing Game
Similar to the arcade game Crossy Road, this game involves the player moving a turtle across the screen amid moving cars

## Gameplay
- Run the `main.py` file to start the game
- Use the Up arrow to move the turtle across the screen
- If the player successfully moves the turtle across, the game goes up a level and the speed of the cars increase
- If the player hits a car, the game ends
